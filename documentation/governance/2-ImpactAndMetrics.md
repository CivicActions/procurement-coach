# Impact and Metrics

This document addresses the intended impact of this project and how that impact is measured.

## **North Star Goal**

A North Star goal is a sentence or two that summarizes what the project or product will attempt to achieve. This goal statement is used as a benchmark against which to assess priorities at all levels of project and product management. The North Star Goal, once agreed upon by the client and the project team, will appear in other places/other documentation sets as well. This allows us to pull things back into focus when there is friction or distraction.

## **External Metrics**

Describe “external” success metrics, including:

- Impact objectives
- Measures of success (e.g. “souls saved”)
- Capacity metrics
- Utilization metrics
- Stories about “wins” that support the North Star goal

## **Metrics Review**

- Describe how the team routinely updates, reviews, evaluates and reassesses metrics
