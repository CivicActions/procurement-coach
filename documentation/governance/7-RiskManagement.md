## RiskManagement.md

This document describes key risks, steps taken to mitigate those risks, and who is responsible for reviewing and managing those risks, (keeping in mind that this document is meant to be public).




## **Business Impact Assessment (BIA)**

Describe the impact of the system failure/breeches on the operations of its parent organization.




## **High level risks**

Describe high-level project risks that may prevent achieving the North Star goal. Outline the steps needed to mitigate those risks, who is responsible for ensuring that the risks are addressed, and your recommendation on how to address the risk. 

- Be sure to include and address the OWASP Top 10 risks (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ ) in your narrative.

- Review the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) to ensure your risk narrative accurately identifies potential project threats.

- Include identification of any content that contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or HVA (high value assets).

- These risks should include project-level and not just technical risks, including competition, defunding, skill/resource availability, timelines, bureaucratic/decision-making obstacles, political considerations

- Consider adding links to a risks register (if it can be made public)

  

### **Example risk ledger format:**


| **Risk**                                                     | **Complete project funding is not currently authorized**     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Threats and hazards**                                      | The project may not be launch-able due to lack of funding    |
| **Threat components***Capability, intent, motivation and opportunity* | Agency funding is in jeopardy due to current reorganization. The project is a high priority for the current administration, but priority is unknown for the incoming administration. |
| **Likelihood** *(high, medium, low)*                         | Medium                                                       |
| **Vulnerability** *(high, medium, low)*                      | High                                                         |
| **Mitigation options** *Procedural, physical, personnel, technical* | Manage the project so that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is launch-able within the current budget period. Ensure that each release can be made public and sustained. Create a roadmap that prioritizes public releases and product sustainability. |
| **Business impact**                                          | Legislative mandate calling for this service will remain unfulfilled |
| **Willingness to accept risk**                               | Depends on the incoming administration. Unknown.             |
| **Recommendations** *(including timelines)*                  | Launch an MVP at the end of the third quarter and use the fourth quarter to ensure the service is sustainable. |
| **Risk Identifier**                                          | Who reported the risk/when                                   |
| **Frequency of review**                                      | How often should this risk be re-assessed?                   |
